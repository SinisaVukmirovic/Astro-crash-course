## Astro Crash Course
___

#### Astro uses a superset of hTML and it is dynamic. We can put JS expresion inside of { } and it will get evaluated.
#### We can also add JS vars inside of a Front Matter (every thing inside of a triple --- at the top) and use it in HTML inside of a { }
#### We can put styles inside of <style></style> tags in Astro, and style in Astro are scoped, any style within a component is portrayed only inside of that component(page).

### Astro uses top-level Async, so we can just use await without async when fethcing some external API data
